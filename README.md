# python_dsa

### This repository documents my journey of learning Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) using Python.
### I’ll be uploading new files close to daily, covering core concepts, implementations, and logic-building exercises.
### Along the way, I’ll also solve a variety of DSA questions to strengthen problem-solving, pattern recognition, and coding efficiency.
### The purpose of this repo is to track my progress, build strong fundamentals, and develop the skills needed to tackle real interview-level problems.
### Over time, this will grow into a structured collection of notes, code snippets, and solutions that reflect my continuous improvement in DSA.
